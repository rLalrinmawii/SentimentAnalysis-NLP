# Sentiment Analysis with Text Data

## Introduction
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on text data using various techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, vectorization, and machine learning models. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, which can be positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code.

## Usage
- The main script or Jupyter Notebook contains code for the following tasks:
  1. Data preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
  2. Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like Count Vectorization and TF-IDF.
  3. Sentiment Analysis: Training and testing machine learning models to classify text sentiment.
  4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  5. Visualization: Generating visualizations such as word clouds and histograms to understand the data and model results.

## Data
- The data used in this project consists of textual reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

## Conclusion
- This codebase demonstrates the process of sentiment analysis on textual data. It involves preprocessing the text, converting it into numerical features, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. The goal is to accurately classify text sentiment, which can be useful in various applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and product reviews.
